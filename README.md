# Electron Demo

Demonstration of the use of Electron to make a desktop app from Web tools

I will use branches to show the changes

## Web

This will show a "hipster clock" I created using HTML5 and Canvas.

## Node

This uses Node and NPM to make a web service of said clock on some high-number port.

## Electron

This makes a windowed application started with an npm start command

## Packaging

Creating said app so that I can install it without Node, NPM, etc.
